# Data Structure

## Heap

A heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property:
- In a max heap, for any given child node, key of parent node is greater
than or equal to the key of child node.
- In a min heap, for any given child node, key of parent node is less or
equal to the key of child node.
